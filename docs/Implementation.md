## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Structure:

```
POST /api/tts/synthesize - Convert text to speech
POST /api/voices/clone - Create custom voice from audio sample
GET /api/voices/list - Get available voices
POST /api/audio/upload - Upload audio files
GET /api/audio/download/{filename} - Download generated audio
GET /api/voices/export/{voice_id} - Export voice model
DELETE /api/voices/{voice_id} - Delete voice model
```

### Local Storage Structure:

- **localStorage.userPreferences**: User settings (theme, language, default voice)
- **localStorage.voiceProfiles**: Voice metadata (name, language, file paths)
- **localStorage.recentGenerations**: Recently generated audio file references
- **File System Structure:**
  - `/storage/voices/` - Voice model files organized by voice ID
  - `/storage/audio/` - Generated audio files with timestamp-based naming
  - `/storage/uploads/` - Temporary uploaded files for voice cloning
  - `/storage/cache/` - Cached TTS models and temporary processing files

### Performance Considerations:

- Implement audio streaming for large text inputs
- Use browser caching and localStorage for frequently accessed data
- Optimize model loading with lazy initialization and local caching
- Implement in-memory queue system for voice cloning requests
- Use IndexedDB for storing larger audio files and voice models
- Implement file cleanup routines to manage local storage space
- Cache voice models in memory during active sessions
